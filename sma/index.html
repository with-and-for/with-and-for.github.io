          <h1>Design Philosophy</h1><br><br>
          Shauna McManus Architects works on residential projects all types
          ranging from new construction to renovating existing and historic structures to interior design.<br><br>
          We bring to each project an in-depth study of the site, the structure, and the client's needs. We incorporate
          environmentally friendly building science to achieve sustainable buildings and energy efficient in all our work.<br><br>
          Current and recent projects include residences and additions in New York, Connecticut, Massachusetts, Washington DC, South Carolina
          and Pennsylvania.<br><br>
          We work on projects from the conceptual design phase through comprehensive design development, working drawings, specs
          and site supervision. We are very hands-on throughout the entire construction and believe that this close working relationship
          with the client and contractors produces successful outcomes both in terms of design as well as sustainable building.
